Android Interpolator Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates the use of animation interpolators and path animations for
`Material Design`.

Introduction
------------

Material design is a comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction
design across platforms and devices. Starting with API level 21,
[Android includes support for material design][1] apps.

This sample demonstrates the use of `Material Design` animation interpolators
and path animations. It uses an [ObjectAnimator][2] to animate two view properties,
`Scale_X` and `Scale_Y`. Users can pick from a set of interpolator options. They
can also define the duration of the animation.
